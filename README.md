# Design Patterns Library
Current patterns contained in this library are:
- Grids
- Headers
- Scrolling Effects (Sticky, Into View)
- Menus

## Software Requirements
Some patterns are implemented in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, so they should function properly in most browsers.
For JSX or TSX components `Node.js version 18.14.1` or above is required, however, older versions may still function properly but I cannot guarantee this.

## Running This Library
Use `npm install` to download node_modules packages, then `npm start` to launch the app in browser.

## Choosing a Design Pattern
In the root directory `App.tsx` imports a particular pattern with: 
`import Pattern from './Design_Patterns/Headers/StickyScroller/StickyScroller';`
Choose whichever pattern suits your needs.

## Reference and More Docs
Each pattern should or already contains readme information about its implementation and features.
